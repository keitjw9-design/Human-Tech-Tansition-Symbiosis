## Overview

The Leviathan–Symbiosis framework describes the stability of coupled human–technology systems.  
It models how deployed technological capability must remain within the adaptive bandwidth of society to avoid divergence, instability, or collapse.

The central claim:

> Civilizational stability requires that deployed capability growth not exceed human adaptive capacity.

## Core State Variables

- **H(t)** — human adaptive capacity  
- **T(t)** — technological capability trajectory  
- **T_deploy(t)** — deployed capability in society  
- **G(t)=T_deploy/H** — mismatch (gap ratio)  
- **B(H)** — adaptive bandwidth (safe deployment rate)

## Adaptive Capacity Model

Human adaptive capacity saturates:
