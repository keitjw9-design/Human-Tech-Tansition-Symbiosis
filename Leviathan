## Definition

The **Leviathan model** describes coupled growth between deployed propulsion capability (T) and enabling space infrastructure (H), where thrust accelerates infrastructure expansion and infrastructure increases the rate of thrust deployment.

---

## Core Equations

Infrastructure-enabled thrust growth:

dT/dt = a H^α

Thrust-enabled infrastructure growth:

dH/dt = c T^β

---

## Symbiosis Condition

Self-reinforcing expansion occurs when:

αβ > 1

This regime is termed **Leviathan symbiosis**.

---

## Physical Interpretation (Space Systems)

- **T** — deployed nuclear-electric tug thrust  
- **H** — reactors, radiators, depots, truss, propellant supply, assembly capacity  
- **a** — thrust per infrastructure efficiency  
- **c** — infrastructure built per thrust throughput  

---

## Engineering Meaning

Deployed tugs transport and assemble infrastructure that increases available power and propulsion, which in turn enables deployment of more tug thrust.

---

## Control Metric

Infrastructure utilization ratio:

G(t) = T_deploy / H

---

## Leviathan Symbiosis (One-Line)

> Deployed thrust builds infrastructure, and infrastructure accelerates thrust deployment.

---

## Domain

Applies to:

- nuclear-electric tug fleets  
- in-space logistics networks  
- orbital infrastructure growth  

---

## Status

Conceptual growth model for self-reinforcing space transportation ecosystems.
